## Who Controls Texas Area Codes?

In the state of Texas, the authority to decide when to introduce new
area codes is vested with the Public Utility Commission (PUC). Texas
area codes are limited to use only within the state. New area codes are
often created to meet the increased demand for phone numbers. In 2000,
the PUC took steps towards reclaiming numbers that were no longer in
service.
