## What are Texas Phone Numbers?

The landscape of phone numbers, carriers, and users has changed a great
deal over the last 20 years. In 2015, the percentage of homes with only
cell phones surpassed those with working landline phones, and as of
2018, homes with landline subscriptions represent only 41.7% of Texans.
Up to 68% are wireless only, while landline only households were as low
as 3%, indicating that landline subscriptions are in [their waning
days](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/Wireless_state_201912-508.pdf&sa=D&ust=1596882378616000&usg=AOvVaw0y90us0XaKQCMz3DSZA75O).
As of the year 2020, the United States and Texas had 5 major phone
carriers which includes Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US
Cellular. Percentages of market share for each of these companies are
approximately:

-   AT&T with 39.9%
-   Verizon with 29.2%
-   T-Mobile with 16.4%
-   Sprint with 13.3%
-   US Cellular with 1.2%

Besides landlines and wireless carriers, Voice of Internet Protocol
(VoIP) services are also increasing in popularity. As of 2015, use of
VoIP numbers for both business and personal applications has increased
from 34.2 million in 2010 to 84.5 million. Today, there has been a
further increase to over 118  million in 2018.

offered or operated by VoIP companies.

## Can I Search a Phone Number and Find Out Who it Is?

The simple answer is yes. Essential information, such as name, address,
and contact information, are required when registering a phone number.
Therefore, anyone can use reverse phone lookup services to perform a
phone number search, and find out who is behind the phone. There are
several methods for doing this, and can include phone number lookup by
address or by name, or by using a phone number lookup to find a person's
address, name, or other information. When you receive a suspicious phone
number lookup services are available to help shed some light on the
caller. However, scams that are common often utilize the ability to fake
the phone number that appears on the receiving end. This means it is
difficult to answer the question of “who is this number registered to.”

## Is there a Free Way to Lookup Someone’s Phone Number?

There are several services that offer ways to find out who called you,
and learn some information about a phone number, though none of them
will offer all information without some form of payment. Nonetheless,
using these services to get some information can be useful when using
secondary and tertiary services to expand your research. Using this, you
may be able to learn more about an individual, such as their location,
their name, and if they have any criminal record.

## Texas Area Codes and Their Locations

Recognizing area codes within Texas and the cities they represent may
help in sifting unwanted or potentially fraudulent calls. For instance,
a resident will be less obliged to take a call from an area code they
are not familiar with.

## What are Phone Lookup Services?

With the rapid growth of the internet and extensive allocation of phone
numbers, phone number lookup services have become a lot more common.
Caller ID allows every telephone user to know which number is calling
before they even pick up the phone, and this has led to increased
telephone security. However, as telephone security and knowledge grows,
so has the efforts of telephone scammers. Using internet based voice
over internet protocol (VoIP) services, the ability to trick a caller ID
into showing a false number, and tools to route a phone call through an
unsuspecting victim’s phone, phone scams are just as prolific as ever.
Understanding what to look for when identifying a phone scam has never
been more important, and understanding how scammers use VoIP, false
phone numbers, area codes, prefix codes and subscriber information is
critical to avoiding scammers and robocallers.

## What is a VoIP Number?

A phone call is, in essence, a transfer of data across long distances,
which is the same principle used by the internet. Early internet
connectivity came to the United States via phone lines, and VoIP(Voice
over Internet Protocol) is phone use coming full circle to in turn
utilize the internet. When a VoIP service assigns a number, it is
assigning it to the individual instead of a specific phone line. VoIP
technology can support texting and video calls just as with a standard
phone line, and can utilize expansive data networks rather than
traveling through traditional and somewhat outdated copper-wire
infrastructures. Essentially, VoIP is the future of phone calls, as
traditional direct phone lines and calls are made obsolete by the
efficiency and breadth of the world wide web.

As usual, phone scammers are moving right along with the new advances
introduced by VoIP technologies. Because VoIP numbers are assigned to an
individual, there is no way to perform a phone number lookup and no
location data associated with the number as there is with traditional
phone numbers. As long as a stable internet connection exists, a scammer
can call from anywhere in the world with an American phone number.
Further, multiple devices can be linked to the VoIP number, meaning
nothing related to the device, such as the IMEI number, can be tracked
or associated with scam calls. VoIP numbers can be created and destroyed
in a matter of minutes, and multiple phone calls can be made
simultaneously.

Because VoIP phone scams can be so difficult to detect, it is
recommended to use caution when answering an unexpected call, even when
the number is known. Some of the FTC recommended [best
practices](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-block-unwanted-calls&sa=D&ust=1596882378632000&usg=AOvVaw2mhv4NEr-hLPcbgpB2Q2GQ) and
tips to detect a spam caller, VoIP or otherwise, can be found below.
