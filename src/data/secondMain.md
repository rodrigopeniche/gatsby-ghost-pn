## How to Deal with a Stalker

The direct nature of a telephone number means that it is attractive to
those that wish to stalk, harass, or track an individual. As mentioned
previously, phone numbers are more personal than ever before thanks to
VoIP lines and user specific phone numbers. Phone numbers are no longer
only location based, meaning that if someone gains knowledge of an
individual's number, there is little that person can do to remove their
access. Some of the best practices when dealing with stalkers is to
distance oneself from this person in any way possible, and to repeatedly
not engage. Other steps include:

-   Requesting a phone number change. This is the best way to remove a
    stalker’s access. Changing a phone number takes away a piece of
    knowledge and makes it significantly harder for them to track or
    call the number in question.
-   Hang up the phone. Stalkers are not calling for no reason; they want
    to engage. If an unknown person wishes to engage through a phone
    call, the best practice is to deny them this. Do not even attempt to
    verbally attack or reason. They may even lose interest.
-   Block any unknown numbers. Contact family and friends and alert them
    to the issue so they understand why they may not be able to reach
    you through unfamiliar numbers. Blocking should be considered
    preemptive disengagement. If a stalker cannot reach their intended
    target, they may move on.
-   If all else fails, alert the police. Stalkers may resort to acts of
    violence, and if they are able to track the location of a device
    through the phone number, they may be able to cause physical harm.
    Be wary of this, and take precautions should other methods fail to
    deter a stalker’s attention.

Thankfully, this principle works both ways; if someone calls, their
number is now known to the intended victim. Phone lookup services may
serve as a first line of defense. When receiving a call from an unknown
number, a phone lookup service may shed light on the would-be stalker.
Given a phone number, phone look-up services can offer names, addresses,
and even criminal records of individuals. As mentioned, it is better to
be safe than sorry, and any amount of knowledge gained about a stalker
can be life-saving.

## What is a Texas Phone Number Area Code?

Area codes were implemented in the 1940s as part of the North American
Numbering Plan by the Bell Phone Companies, American Telegraph and
Telephone (AT&T) as a means to unify the decades-old preexisting varied
local numbering system and simplify calling between regions and catering
for a growing population.

Area codes identify geographic regions such as a city or different parts
of a State and are currently regulated by the <ins>[Federal Communications
Commission](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview&sa=D&ust=1596882378641000&usg=AOvVaw3nuUZcxf59WxkrbRl_r5pm) (FCC).
NANPA is under the administration of the FCC. The FCC gives each State
the authority to make decisions on the introduction of area codes within
its borders. In Texas,</ins> [the Public Utility
Commission](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.puc.texas.gov/&sa=D&ust=1596882378641000&usg=AOvVaw1yRJ6GME6Xm3jMVNVi-WkT) (PUC)
has the responsibility of notifying the Texas public of new Area codes
assigned to Texas by <ins>[The North American Numbering Plan
