## Texas Reverse Phone Lookup

Reverse phone search, or phone number lookup, refers to the process in
which an individual can discover more about the person behind a phone
number. Because paperwork and other information is required to be
provided when being granted a phone number, it is possible to learn more
about the individual calling you simply by using the phone number they
used to call.

# Texas Phone Numbers and Scams -->

## What are Texas Phone Numbers?

The landscape of phone numbers, carriers, and users has changed a great
deal over the last 20 years. In 2015, the percentage of homes with only
cell phones surpassed those with working landline phones, and as of
2018, homes with landline subscriptions represent only 41.7% of Texans.
Up to 68% are wireless only, while landline only households were as low
as 3%, indicating that landline subscriptions are in [their waning
days](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/Wireless_state_201912-508.pdf&sa=D&ust=1596882378616000&usg=AOvVaw0y90us0XaKQCMz3DSZA75O).
As of the year 2020, the United States and Texas had 5 major phone
carriers which includes Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US
Cellular. Percentages of market share for each of these companies are
approximately:

-   AT&T with 39.9%
-   Verizon with 29.2%
-   T-Mobile with 16.4%
-   Sprint with 13.3%
-   US Cellular with 1.2%

Besides landlines and wireless carriers, Voice of Internet Protocol
(VoIP) services are also increasing in popularity. As of 2015, use of
VoIP numbers for both business and personal applications has increased
from 34.2 million in 2010 to 84.5 million. Today, there has been a
further increase to over 118  million in 2018.

<span style="color:red">XX</span> prefix codes (the center three numbers in a phone number) are either
offered or operated by VoIP companies.

## Can I Search a Phone Number and Find Out Who it Is?

The simple answer is yes. Essential information, such as name, address,
and contact information, are required when registering a phone number.
Therefore, anyone can use reverse phone lookup services to perform a
phone number search, and find out who is behind the phone. There are
several methods for doing this, and can include phone number lookup by
address or by name, or by using a phone number lookup to find a person's
address, name, or other information. When you receive a suspicious phone
number lookup services are available to help shed some light on the
caller. However, scams that are common often utilize the ability to fake
the phone number that appears on the receiving end. This means it is
difficult to answer the question of “who is this number registered to.”

## Is there a Free Way to Lookup Someone’s Phone Number?

There are several services that offer ways to find out who called you,
and learn some information about a phone number, though none of them
will offer all information without some form of payment. Nonetheless,
using these services to get some information can be useful when using
secondary and tertiary services to expand your research. Using this, you
may be able to learn more about an individual, such as their location,
their name, and if they have any criminal record.

## Texas Area Codes and Their Locations

Recognizing area codes within Texas and the cities they represent may
help in sifting unwanted or potentially fraudulent calls. For instance,
a resident will be less obliged to take a call from an area code they
are not familiar with.

## What are Phone Lookup Services?

With the rapid growth of the internet and extensive allocation of phone
numbers, phone number lookup services have become a lot more common.
Caller ID allows every telephone user to know which number is calling
before they even pick up the phone, and this has led to increased
telephone security. However, as telephone security and knowledge grows,
so has the efforts of telephone scammers. Using internet based voice
over internet protocol (VoIP) services, the ability to trick a caller ID
into showing a false number, and tools to route a phone call through an
unsuspecting victim’s phone, phone scams are just as prolific as ever.
Understanding what to look for when identifying a phone scam has never
been more important, and understanding how scammers use VoIP, false
phone numbers, area codes, prefix codes and subscriber information is
critical to avoiding scammers and robocallers.

## What is a VoIP Number?

A phone call is, in essence, a transfer of data across long distances,
which is the same principle used by the internet. Early internet
connectivity came to the United States via phone lines, and VoIP(Voice
over Internet Protocol) is phone use coming full circle to in turn
utilize the internet. When a VoIP service assigns a number, it is
assigning it to the individual instead of a specific phone line. VoIP
technology can support texting and video calls just as with a standard
phone line, and can utilize expansive data networks rather than
traveling through traditional and somewhat outdated copper-wire
infrastructures. Essentially, VoIP is the future of phone calls, as
traditional direct phone lines and calls are made obsolete by the
efficiency and breadth of the world wide web.

As usual, phone scammers are moving right along with the new advances
introduced by VoIP technologies. Because VoIP numbers are assigned to an
individual, there is no way to perform a phone number lookup and no
location data associated with the number as there is with traditional
phone numbers. As long as a stable internet connection exists, a scammer
can call from anywhere in the world with an American phone number.
Further, multiple devices can be linked to the VoIP number, meaning
nothing related to the device, such as the IMEI number, can be tracked
or associated with scam calls. VoIP numbers can be created and destroyed
in a matter of minutes, and multiple phone calls can be made
simultaneously.

Because VoIP phone scams can be so difficult to detect, it is
recommended to use caution when answering an unexpected call, even when
the number is known. Some of the FTC recommended [best
practices](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-block-unwanted-calls&sa=D&ust=1596882378632000&usg=AOvVaw2mhv4NEr-hLPcbgpB2Q2GQ) and

5.  Car warranty scams, where the scammer attempts to sell overpriced
    and useless car insurance
6.  Travel or timeshare scams, where the scammer promises low-cost

7.  Prize scams, where the scammer offers a prize in exchange for

9.  Loan scams, where the scammer targets people with low credit scores

## 10 Steps to Avoiding Being a Victim of a Phone Scam

1.  Be aware that anyone can be a victim of a phone scam. There is a
    possibility that any unknown or unsolicited call from a vaguely
    familiar or unfamiliar number may be from a fraudster. Be cautious
    when dealing with unknown numbers or completely ignoring them may be
    safer.
2.  Register on the <ins>[National Do Not Call
    Registry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.donotcall.gov/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw265y6m8RUlmpWHs9sZq04_).
    Texas still ranks very low, 50th (according to a study by
    safehome.org), in the number of residents that have registered their
    numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. Texas also has its own
    [Do Not Call
    List](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasnocall.com/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw1tgD5OtnkT4HNqEyr0pCd5).

    this statewide list. Both registries restrain telemarketers and
    legitimate organizations from calling the registered numbers.
    Although the registries can not prevent scam calls, they can reduce
    the number of unsolicited calls received by the recipient and put
    the recipient on high alert when an unknown number claims to be from
    a known telemarketer who is restrained from calling the recipient.</ins>
3.  Terminate robocalls immediately after realizing what they are.
4.  Do some research on unfamiliar contacts, investment opportunities,
    new business associates, charities, opportunities. service providers
    or deals.
5.  Keep personal information secure including passwords and pins. Many
    legitimate organizations such as banks and government agencies will
    never ask a recipient to disclose sensitive personal information
    over the phone.
6.  Ask questions calmly and wait for a response from callers without
    being rushed, listen for familiar voices and confirmation of
    mutually known information. People often call emergency services for
    assistance during emergencies rather than family members.
7.  Avoid using free unprotected Wi-fi in public places. Personal
    information is susceptible to theft on shared public networks.
8.  Be wary of numbers from international area codes and unknown local
    area codes. Avoid getting pressured into making quick decisions.
9.  Report fraud or suspicion of fraud and identity theft to
    the [FTC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ftc.gov/complaint&sa=D&ust=1596882378635000&usg=AOvVaw2NF63aMofZVYKAfyX-dq0X)
10. Stay informed on scam and fraud trends. Obtain updates from
    organizations such as the <ins>[Association of Certified Fraud
    Examiners](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources.aspx&sa=D&ust=1596882378635000&usg=AOvVaw1bqxtR4vSsLHc56esikuit) (ACFE).</ins>

### Texas Tech Support Scams

These scams begin with a report via phone or through a computer that
viruses have been detected. These scams request a call to a number to
grant access to a computer for the company they are masquerading as. The
TAG recommends using extreme skepticism when being contacted by a
computer or phone company in this way. They remind Texans that
legitimate tech support and computer companies do not contact their
customers randomly or at all for matters such as these.

### Texas Voice Phishing Scams

Phishing is when a scammer contacts a potential victim through email,
mail, texts or calls asking for a social security number, a bank
account, or passwords. Voice phishing relies on the call receiver
trusting the scammer enough to reveal information about themselves. They
typically claim to companies of repute, and that they need the number to
secure the account. The TAG advises Texans to NEVER give their personal
information over the phone when the request for such information comes
unsolicited.

### What is a Texas RoboCall?

A robocall is an automated or pre-recorded call that relies on clever
timing to convince the call receiver that the person on the other end of
the line is a real human. They are most commonly associated with
telemarketing and political awareness campaigns but are some of the most
common phone scam tactics. For this reason, extra caution should be
taken during election seasons, and holiday seasons when these types of
calls are used by legitimate organizations, making them extremely
difficult to differentiate.

In 2019, Texas’ Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an initiative, in
conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to <ins>[start a
crackdown on illegal
robocalls](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-ftc-announce-new-crackdown-illegal-robocalls&sa=D&ust=1596882378636000&usg=AOvVaw24fKrpZfjSTeR74ambKEc-).

countrywide.</ins>

### What are Texas Emergency Scams?

The TAG may refer to this type of scam as “Grandparent Scams” as they
primarily prey on the elderly. These scams claim to be for family
members or friends who are in dire need. These types of scams are heavy
users of caller ID spoofing to help sell the idea that the call is
coming from someone the call receiver knows. The scammer may even
disguise their voice or claim to sound different due to emotional stress
or injury. Advice for avoiding or detecting this scam is to stay calm,
and ask questions. If not convinced, try to reach out to the known
person in question using normal means such as a phone number or social
media contact to determine if they are in trouble, as the call claims.

### What are Texas IRS Scams?

Texas IRS or government scams are particularly dangerous during tax
season, as that is when potential victims would expect a call from the
IRS. The call claims to be an IRS agent, and further, claims that back
taxes are owed. This is usually made in conjunction with the threat of
an audit. The IRS is aware of the scam, and Variations of this scam exist, and these usually claim to be local law
enforcement calling about an outstanding warrant. In either case, the
scammer is using fear as a method for convincing the potential victim to
reveal information or pay money.

### What is Phone Spoofing?

This tactic has come to light more prominently as phone scammers have
increasingly used Caller ID Spoofing to trick the receiving handset into
displaying the number of someone else, or even someone who the receiver
is familiar with. The scenario of an individual’s child, sibling,
parent, or trusted professional calling only for them to discover a
robocall is more common than it once was.
Typical phone spoofs involve a scammer tricking a caller ID into
displaying a local number or the number of a trusted (government)
organization to their intended victim. This helps sell the legitimacy of
the offer before the person even answers the phone, and is particularly
effective when used against the uninformed or the elderly. Common spoofs
as of 2019 include:

1.  A scammer, posing as a bank or credit card company, to gain trust
    and steal credit card information
2.  Holiday charity scammers who pose as charitable organizations and
    ask for donations, particularly around the holidays when legitimate

## What are Private Organisations doing to Stop Spam Calls?

In addition to government methods to combat phone spam and robocalls,
the private sector also provides tools to block or detect suspicious
activity. Often on higher-end phones this feature is standard.

**To turn on spam protection on an Android**

1.  Open the devices phone application and tap more (represented by
    three vertically arranged dots.)
2.  Selected Settings, then select Caller ID & Spam
3.  Turn Caller ID & Spam on.
4.  Further, you can turn on Filter Suspected Spam Calls to instruct
    your phone to not ring when you get a call from a suspected spam
    caller. These numbers may still be reviewed in the phone app.
5.  You may also mark phone numbers as spam which will help Google
    predict more accurately in the future.

**To run on spam protection on an iOS or Apple device**

1.  Open the phone settings, and select “phone.”
2.  Scroll down to the option “Silence Unknown Callers.” This will
    silence incoming calls that are not saved in your phone.
3.  Another option is to download an app that detects or blocks
    suspected spam calls. Download this app, and open your phone
    settings.
4.  Click on Phone in settings, and scroll to “Call Blocking &
    Identification.
5.  Here you may select multiple apps to help block or detect unwanted
    calls

## How to Deal with a Stalker

The direct nature of a telephone number means that it is attractive to
those that wish to stalk, harass, or track an individual. As mentioned
previously, phone numbers are more personal than ever before thanks to
VoIP lines and user specific phone numbers. Phone numbers are no longer
only location based, meaning that if someone gains knowledge of an
individual's number, there is little that person can do to remove their
access. Some of the best practices when dealing with stalkers is to
distance oneself from this person in any way possible, and to repeatedly
not engage. Other steps include:

-   Requesting a phone number change. This is the best way to remove a
    stalker’s access. Changing a phone number takes away a piece of
    knowledge and makes it significantly harder for them to track or
    call the number in question.
-   Hang up the phone. Stalkers are not calling for no reason; they want
    to engage. If an unknown person wishes to engage through a phone
    call, the best practice is to deny them this. Do not even attempt to
    verbally attack or reason. They may even lose interest.
-   Block any unknown numbers. Contact family and friends and alert them
    to the issue so they understand why they may not be able to reach
    you through unfamiliar numbers. Blocking should be considered
    preemptive disengagement. If a stalker cannot reach their intended
    target, they may move on.
-   If all else fails, alert the police. Stalkers may resort to acts of
    violence, and if they are able to track the location of a device
    through the phone number, they may be able to cause physical harm.
    Be wary of this, and take precautions should other methods fail to
    deter a stalker’s attention.

Thankfully, this principle works both ways; if someone calls, their
number is now known to the intended victim. Phone lookup services may
serve as a first line of defense. When receiving a call from an unknown
number, a phone lookup service may shed light on the would-be stalker.
Given a phone number, phone look-up services can offer names, addresses,
and even criminal records of individuals. As mentioned, it is better to
be safe than sorry, and any amount of knowledge gained about a stalker
can be life-saving.

## What is a Texas Phone Number Area Code?

Area codes were implemented in the 1940s as part of the North American
Numbering Plan by the Bell Phone Companies, American Telegraph and
Telephone (AT&T) as a means to unify the decades-old preexisting varied
local numbering system and simplify calling between regions and catering
for a growing population.

Area codes identify geographic regions such as a city or different parts
of a State and are currently regulated by the <ins>[Federal Communications
Commission](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview&sa=D&ust=1596882378641000&usg=AOvVaw3nuUZcxf59WxkrbRl_r5pm) (FCC).
NANPA is under the administration of the FCC. The FCC gives each State
the authority to make decisions on the introduction of area codes within
its borders. In Texas,</ins> [the Public Utility
Commission](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.puc.texas.gov/&sa=D&ust=1596882378641000&usg=AOvVaw1yRJ6GME6Xm3jMVNVi-WkT) (PUC)
has the responsibility of notifying the Texas public of new Area codes
assigned to Texas by <ins>[The North American Numbering Plan
Administration](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationalnanpa.com/about_us/&sa=D&ust=1596882378642000&usg=AOvVaw3EFEk07XBYTRnbctokQhKT) (NANPA).</ins>

## What is a Texas Phone Number Prefix Code?

A prefix code - also commonly referred to as an exchange code or central
office code - refers to the first set of digits that occurs in a phone
number after the area code. For instance, with the telephone number
(234) 235-7856.

-   234 is the area code
-   235 is the prefix code

For numbers that include the country code, the prefix code occurs after
the country code and area code. For instance with +1 (234) 235-7856

-   +1 is the country code for the United States
-   234 is the area code
-   235 is the prefix code

## Who Controls Texas Area Codes?

In the state of Texas, the authority to decide when to introduce new
area codes is vested with the Public Utility Commission (PUC). Texas
area codes are limited to use only within the state. New area codes are
often created to meet the increased demand for phone numbers. In 2000,
the PUC took steps towards reclaiming numbers that were no longer in
service.
