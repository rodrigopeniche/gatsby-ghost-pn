In 2015, the percentage of homes with only\ncell phones surpassed those with working landline phones, and as of\n2018, homes with landline subscriptions represent only 41.7% of Texans.\nUp to 68% are wireless only, while landline only households were as low\nas 3%, indicating that landline subscriptions are in [their waning\ndays](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/Wireless_state_201912-508.pdf&sa=D&ust=1596882378616000&usg=AOvVaw0y90us0XaKQCMz3DSZA75O).\nAs of the year 2020, the United States and Texas had 5 major phone\ncarriers which includes Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US\nCellular. Percentages of market share for each of these companies are\napproximately:\n\n-   AT&T with 39.9%\n-   Verizon with 29.2%\n-   T-Mobile with 16.4%\n-   Sprint with 13.3%\n-   US Cellular with 1.2%\n\nBesides landlines and wireless carriers, Voice of Internet Protocol\n(VoIP) services are also increasing in popularity. As of 2015, use of\nVoIP numbers for both business and personal applications has increased\nfrom 34.2 million in 2010 to 84.5 million. Today, there has been a\nfurther increase to over 118  million in 2018.\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">XX</span> prefix codes (the center three numbers in a phone number) are either\noffered or operated by VoIP companies.\n\n## Can I Search a Phone Number and Find Out Who it Is?\n\nThe simple answer is yes. Essential information, such as name, address,\nand contact information, are required when registering a phone number.\nTherefore, anyone can use reverse phone lookup services to perform a\nphone number search, and find out who is behind the phone. There are\nseveral methods for doing this, and can include phone number lookup by\naddress or by name, or by using a phone number lookup to find a person's\naddress, name, or other information. When you receive a suspicious phone\nnumber lookup services are available to help shed some light on the\ncaller. However, scams that are common often utilize the ability to fake\nthe phone number that appears on the receiving end. This means it is\ndifficult to answer the question of “who is this number registered to.”\n\n## Is there a Free Way to Lookup Someone’s Phone Number?\n\nThere are several services that offer ways to find out who called you,\nand learn some information about a phone number, though none of them\nwill offer all information without some form of payment. Nonetheless,\nusing these services to get some information can be useful when using\nsecondary and tertiary services to expand your research. Using this, you\nmay be able to learn more about an individual, such as their location,\ntheir name, and if they have any criminal record.\n\n## Texas Area Codes and Their Locations\n\nRecognizing area codes within Texas and the cities they represent may\nhelp in sifting unwanted or potentially fraudulent calls. For instance,\na resident will be less obliged to take a call from an area code they\nare not familiar with.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 210 -

However, as telephone security and knowledge grows,\nso has the efforts of telephone scammers. Using internet based voice\nover internet protocol (VoIP) services, the ability to trick a caller ID\ninto showing a false number, and tools to route a phone call through an\nunsuspecting victim’s phone, phone scams are just as prolific as ever.\nUnderstanding what to look for when identifying a phone scam has never\nbeen more important, and understanding how scammers use VoIP, false\nphone numbers, area codes, prefix codes and subscriber information is\ncritical to avoiding scammers and robocallers.\n\n## What is a VoIP Number?\n\nA phone call is, in essence, a transfer of data across long distances,\nwhich is the same principle used by the internet. Early internet\nconnectivity came to the United States via phone lines, and VoIP(Voice\nover Internet Protocol) is phone use coming full circle to in turn\nutilize the internet. When a VoIP service assigns a number, it is\nassigning it to the individual instead of a specific phone line. VoIP\ntechnology can support texting and video calls just as with a standard\nphone line, and can utilize expansive data networks rather than\ntraveling through traditional and somewhat outdated copper-wire\ninfrastructures. Essentially, VoIP is the future of phone calls, as\ntraditional direct phone lines and calls are made obsolete by the\nefficiency and breadth of the world wide web.\n\nAs usual, phone scammers are moving right along with the new advances\nintroduced by VoIP technologies. Because VoIP numbers are assigned to an\nindividual, there is no way to perform a phone number lookup and no\nlocation data associated with the number as there is with traditional\nphone numbers. As long as a stable internet connection exists, a scammer\ncan call from anywhere in the world with an American phone number.\nFurther, multiple devices can be linked to the VoIP number, meaning\nnothing related to the device, such as the IMEI number, can be tracked\nor associated with scam calls. VoIP numbers can be created and destroyed\nin a matter of minutes, and multiple phone calls can be made\nsimultaneously.\n\nBecause VoIP phone scams can be so difficult to detect, it is\nrecommended to use caution when answering an unexpected call, even when\nthe number is known. Some of the FTC recommended [best\npractices](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-block-unwanted-calls&sa=D&ust=1596882378632000&usg=AOvVaw2mhv4NEr-hLPcbgpB2Q2GQ) and\ntips to detect a spam caller, VoIP or otherwise, can be found below.\n\n## What are Texas Phone Scams?\n\nThe <ins>[Texas Attorney General’s\noffice](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/phone-mail-and-fax-scams&sa=D&ust=1596882378632000&usg=AOvVaw2mO-LfRtWIfGUZQjZ3wsKX) (TAG)\nhas taken the lead on mail fraud, fax fraud, phone scam awareness for\nthe citizens of Texas.

There is a\n    possibility that any unknown or unsolicited call from a vaguely\n    familiar or unfamiliar number may be from a fraudster. Be cautious\n    when dealing with unknown numbers or completely ignoring them may be\n    safer.\n2.  Register on the <ins>[National Do Not Call\n    Registry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.donotcall.gov/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw265y6m8RUlmpWHs9sZq04_).\n    Texas still ranks very low, 50th (according to a study by\n    safehome.org), in the number of residents that have registered their\n    numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. Texas also has its own\n    [Do Not Call\n    List](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasnocall.com/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw1tgD5OtnkT4HNqEyr0pCd5).\n    [Register your phone\n    number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasnocall.com/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw1tgD5OtnkT4HNqEyr0pCd5) on\n    this statewide list. Both registries restrain telemarketers and\n    legitimate organizations from calling the registered numbers.\n    Although the registries can not prevent scam calls, they can reduce\n    the number of unsolicited calls received by the recipient and put\n    the recipient on high alert when an unknown number claims to be from\n    a known telemarketer who is restrained from calling the recipient.</ins>\n3.  Terminate robocalls immediately after realizing what they are.\n4.  Do some research on unfamiliar contacts, investment opportunities,\n    new business associates, charities, opportunities. service providers\n    or deals.\n5.  Keep personal information secure including passwords and pins. Many\n    legitimate organizations such as banks and government agencies will\n    never ask a recipient to disclose sensitive personal information\n    over the phone.\n6.  Ask questions calmly and wait for a response from callers without\n    being rushed, listen for familiar voices and confirmation of\n    mutually known information. People often call emergency services for\n    assistance during emergencies rather than family members.\n7.  Avoid using free unprotected Wi-fi in public places. Personal\n    information is susceptible to theft on shared public networks.\n8.  Be wary of numbers from international area codes and unknown local\n    area codes.

These scams request a call to a number to\ngrant access to a computer for the company they are masquerading as. The\nTAG recommends using extreme skepticism when being contacted by a\ncomputer or phone company in this way. They remind Texans that\nlegitimate tech support and computer companies do not contact their\ncustomers randomly or at all for matters such as these.\n\n### Texas Voice Phishing Scams\n\nPhishing is when a scammer contacts a potential victim through email,\nmail, texts or calls asking for a social security number, a bank\naccount, or passwords. Voice phishing relies on the call receiver\ntrusting the scammer enough to reveal information about themselves. They\ntypically claim to companies of repute, and that they need the number to\nsecure the account. The TAG advises Texans to NEVER give their personal\ninformation over the phone when the request for such information comes\nunsolicited.\n\n### What is a Texas RoboCall?\n\nA robocall is an automated or pre-recorded call that relies on clever\ntiming to convince the call receiver that the person on the other end of\nthe line is a real human. They are most commonly associated with\ntelemarketing and political awareness campaigns but are some of the most\ncommon phone scam tactics. For this reason, extra caution should be\ntaken during election seasons, and holiday seasons when these types of\ncalls are used by legitimate organizations, making them extremely\ndifficult to differentiate.\n\nIn 2019, Texas’ Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an initiative, in\nconjunction with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to <ins>[start a\ncrackdown on illegal\nrobocalls](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-ftc-announce-new-crackdown-illegal-robocalls&sa=D&ust=1596882378636000&usg=AOvVaw24fKrpZfjSTeR74ambKEc-).\nThis initiative, called</ins> “[Operation <ins>Call it\nQuits,</ins>](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/06/operation-call-it-quits-theres-no-quit-our-fight-against&sa=D&ust=1596882378637000&usg=AOvVaw3fe-setv2rBQuJSxiK-Tax)”\n<ins>would include almost 100 actions that target robocall operations\ncountrywide.</ins>\n\n### What are Texas Emergency Scams?\n\nThe TAG may refer to this type of scam as “Grandparent Scams” as they\nprimarily prey on the elderly. These scams claim to be for family\nmembers or friends who are in dire need. These types of scams are heavy\nusers of caller ID spoofing to help sell the idea that the call is\ncoming from someone the call receiver knows. The scammer may even\ndisguise their voice or claim to sound different due to emotional stress\nor injury. Advice for avoiding or detecting this scam is to stay calm,\nand ask questions. If not convinced, try to reach out to the known\nperson in question using normal means such as a phone number or social\nmedia contact to determine if they are in trouble, as the call claims.\n\n### What are Texas IRS Scams?\n\nTexas IRS or government scams are particularly dangerous during tax\nseason, as that is when potential victims would expect a call from the\nIRS. The call claims to be an IRS agent, and further, claims that back\ntaxes are owed. This is usually made in conjunction with the threat of\nan audit. The IRS is aware of the scam, and Variations of this scam exist, and these usually claim to be local law\nenforcement calling about an outstanding warrant. In either case, the\nscammer is using fear as a method for convincing the potential victim to\nreveal information or pay money.\n\n### What is Phone Spoofing?\n\nThis tactic has come to light more prominently as phone scammers have\nincreasingly used Caller ID Spoofing to trick the receiving handset into\ndisplaying the number of someone else, or even someone who the receiver\nis familiar with. The scenario of an individual’s child, sibling,\nparent, or trusted professional calling only for them to discover a\nrobocall is more common than it once was.\nTypical phone spoofs involve a scammer tricking a caller ID into\ndisplaying a local number or the number of a trusted (government)\norganization to their intended victim. This helps sell the legitimacy of\nthe offer before the person even answers the phone, and is particularly\neffective when used against the uninformed or the elderly. Common spoofs\nas of 2019 include:\n\n1.  A scammer, posing as a bank or credit card company, to gain trust\n    and steal credit card information\n2.  Holiday charity scammers who pose as charitable organizations and\n    ask for donations, particularly around the holidays when legitimate\n    organizations are doing the same\n3.  <ins>[FCC Call Center spoofed to Chinese consulate\n    calls](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fcc.gov/fcc-alerts-consumers-about-spoofing-1-888-call-fcc-phone-number&sa=D&ust=1596882378638000&usg=AOvVaw1DeqOAlN8yvAj-OulQOC3V) that\n    rely on confusion to convince the people they call, whether that is\n    a Chinese citizen living in the US, or otherwise.

            "content": "## How to Deal with a Stalker\n\nThe direct nature of a telephone number means that it is attractive to\nthose that wish to stalk, harass, or track an individual. As mentioned\npreviously, phone numbers are more personal than ever before thanks to\nVoIP lines and user specific phone numbers. Phone numbers are no longer\nonly location based, meaning that if someone gains knowledge of an\nindividual's number, there is little that person can do to remove their\naccess. Some of the best practices when dealing with stalkers is to\ndistance oneself from this person in any way possible, and to repeatedly\nnot engage. Other steps include:\n\n-   Requesting a phone number change. This is the best way to remove a\n    stalker’s access. Changing a phone number takes away a piece of\n    knowledge and makes it significantly harder for them to track or\n    call the number in question.\n-   Hang up the phone. Stalkers are not calling for no reason; they want\n    to engage. If an unknown person wishes to engage through a phone\n    call, the best practice is to deny them this. Do not even attempt to\n    verbally attack or reason. They may even lose interest.\n-   Block any unknown numbers. Contact family and friends and alert them\n    to the issue so they understand why they may not be able to reach\n    you through unfamiliar numbers. Blocking should be considered\n    preemptive disengagement. If a stalker cannot reach their intended\n    target, they may move on.\n-   If all else fails, alert the police. Stalkers may resort to acts of\n    violence, and if they are able to track the location of a device\n    through the phone number, they may be able to cause physical harm.\n    Be wary of this, and take precautions should other methods fail to\n    deter a stalker’s attention.\n\nThankfully, this principle works both ways; if someone calls, their\nnumber is now known to the intended victim. Phone lookup services may\nserve as a first line of defense. When receiving a call from an unknown\nnumber, a phone lookup service may shed light on the would-be stalker.\nGiven a phone number, phone look-up services can offer names, addresses,\nand even criminal records of individuals. As mentioned, it is better to\nbe safe than sorry, and any amount of knowledge gained about a stalker\ncan be life-saving.\n\n## What is a Texas Phone Number Area Code?\n\nArea codes were implemented in the 1940s as part of the North American\nNumbering Plan by the Bell Phone Companies, American Telegraph and\nTelephone (AT&T) as a means to unify the decades-old preexisting varied\nlocal numbering system and simplify calling between regions and catering\nfor a growing population.\n\nArea codes identify geographic regions such as a city or different parts\nof a State and are currently regulated by the <ins>[Federal Communications\nCommission](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview&sa=D&ust=1596882378641000&usg=AOvVaw3nuUZcxf59WxkrbRl_r5pm) (FCC).\nNANPA is under the administration of the FCC.
