## 10 Steps to Avoiding Being a Victim of a Phone Scam

1.  Be aware that anyone can be a victim of a phone scam. There is a
    possibility that any unknown or unsolicited call from a vaguely
    familiar or unfamiliar number may be from a fraudster. Be cautious
    when dealing with unknown numbers or completely ignoring them may be
    safer.
2.  Register on the <ins>[National Do Not Call
    Registry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.donotcall.gov/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw265y6m8RUlmpWHs9sZq04_).
    Texas still ranks very low, 50th (according to a study by
    safehome.org), in the number of residents that have registered their
    numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. Texas also has its own
    [Do Not Call
    List](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasnocall.com/&sa=D&ust=1596882378634000&usg=AOvVaw1tgD5OtnkT4HNqEyr0pCd5).

    this statewide list. Both registries restrain telemarketers and
    legitimate organizations from calling the registered numbers.
    Although the registries can not prevent scam calls, they can reduce
    the number of unsolicited calls received by the recipient and put
    the recipient on high alert when an unknown number claims to be from
    a known telemarketer who is restrained from calling the recipient.</ins>
3.  Terminate robocalls immediately after realizing what they are.
4.  Do some research on unfamiliar contacts, investment opportunities,
    new business associates, charities, opportunities. service providers
    or deals.
5.  Keep personal information secure including passwords and pins. Many
    legitimate organizations such as banks and government agencies will
    never ask a recipient to disclose sensitive personal information
    over the phone.
6.  Ask questions calmly and wait for a response from callers without
    being rushed, listen for familiar voices and confirmation of
    mutually known information. People often call emergency services for
    assistance during emergencies rather than family members.
7.  Avoid using free unprotected Wi-fi in public places. Personal
    information is susceptible to theft on shared public networks.
8.  Be wary of numbers from international area codes and unknown local
    area codes. Avoid getting pressured into making quick decisions.
9.  Report fraud or suspicion of fraud and identity theft to
    the [FTC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ftc.gov/complaint&sa=D&ust=1596882378635000&usg=AOvVaw2NF63aMofZVYKAfyX-dq0X)
